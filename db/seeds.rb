# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
admin = City.create([{ username: 'tvgs' }, { email: 'info@techvalleygamespace.com' }, { password: 'include.game' }, { password_confirmation: 'include.game' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
